#  FFMpegNeos

A [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader) mod for [Neos VR](https://neos.com/) that brings FFMpeg functionality into Neos.

## Installation
1. Install [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader).
2. Place [FFMpegNeos.zip](https://github.com/dfgHiatus/FFMpegNeos/releases/latest) into your `nml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\NeosVR\nml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with NeosModLoader installed it will create the folder for you. Extract the contents of this file here.
   1. If you are on Linux Native, you must have ffmpeg installed and in the path.
3. Start the game. If you want to verify that the mod is working you can check your Neos logs.
